# Discord Music Bot

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a Discord bot capable of playing audio from a YouTube video in a voice channel.

## Constraints

To deepen my understanding of functional programming, I chose to use the [ts-belt](https://mobily.github.io/ts-belt/ "ts-belt Documentation") JavaScript library throughout the project.
